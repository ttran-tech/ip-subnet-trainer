# IP Subnet Trainer

IP Subnet Trainer is an interactive Python tool designed to help users master subnetting calculations through hands-on practice. The tool randomly generates IP address with CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.0.0/16) and challenges the users to identify or caculate:

:heavy_check_mark: Network Portion

:heavy_check_mark: Host Portion

:heavy_check_mark: Subnet Mask

:heavy_check_mark: Block Size

:heavy_check_mark: Network & Broadcast Addresses

:heavy_check_mark: Usage IP Range
